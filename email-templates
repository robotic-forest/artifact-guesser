"How can I support Artifact Guesser?"

Hi, thanks so much for the kind words! Really means a lot.

I'm still trying to work out ways I can get some healthy community involvement going. The easiest way to support is to just post any fun artifacts you find to social media with a link back to the game.

I'm currently brainstorming different ways to allow users to add comments/images/articles to artifacts that help people identify them, also a place to discuss and create "metas" for time periods and regions, much like people do on geoguesser. For now, if you find any articles, resources that you think would be useful, you can always email them to me :)

I also have a support page for anyone who wants to contribute financially, though I'm not expecting much from this until I've made the game a bit more fully featured - but it's there in case anyone feels like throwing money at me lol

Also If you have any ideas, I'm all ears! Anyway, thanks for reaching out, these types of emails also go a very long way in supporting me, as it always makes my day.

Cheers, Sam
