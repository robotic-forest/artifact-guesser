# Artifact Guesser

Guess artifacts - date, location. WIP

## TODO

Prompts for future tasks:

we need a way to track whether a player is in a multiplayer game. When in the route /multiplayer, you should be able to refresh the page and still be in the game. If however, you try to close the tab, or try to log out, we need a system confirm that asks them if they are sure, as it'll make them forfeit the game. If they forfeit the game, and there is only one player left in the game, it needs to show them that they won, since the other person left the game. that screen should be fullscreen, basically the game summary but with modified text because of the forfeiture.
