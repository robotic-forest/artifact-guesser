Play it here: [https://artifactguesser.com](https://artifactguesser.com)

Artifact Guesser is a game where you guess the country and date of an artifact. Development stage is currently in alpha.
The data used for the artifacts is originally from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as they provide a very nice API to access their collection, with more sources (such as the Harvard Museum, the British Museum, etc) to be added as development progresses.
